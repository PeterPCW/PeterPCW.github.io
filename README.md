# Portfolio Site

Branched from <https://github.com/ProDigresser/Prodigresser.github.io>, thanks!

Plans:

* ~~Get code working on 2023 stack~~
* ~~Update content~~ to be about me (~50%)
* ~~Restyle~~ to my liking (~33%)
* Add linting/testing
* Automate deploy steps
* Document code and steps to build/use

Dreams:

* Convert to Typescript
* Overhaul design with MUI
* We'll see after that
