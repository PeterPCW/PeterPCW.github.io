# Portfolio Site

Branched from <https://github.com/ProDigresser/Prodigresser.github.io>, thanks!

Plans (general):

* ~~Get code working on 2023 stack~~
* ~~Convert to Typescript~~
* ~~Automate deploy steps~~
* ~~Add linting/testing~~
* ~~Update content to be about me~~
* ~~Restyle to my liking~~
* Document code and steps to build/use

V2:

* I've found better sites to model from so I don't plan any major changes here
* I will stash this in a V1 branch and then start working on a complete overhaul down the road (a few other projects are higher in the queue)
